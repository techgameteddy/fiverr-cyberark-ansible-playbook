The playbook is broken into specific tasks to make it job specific when adding jobs in ansible tower.

The playbook does the following and more 
* Creates user account for CyberArk
* Removes user account for CyberArk 
* rotates and resets api key for user specific accounts 
* Deletes and deprovisions a users account 

These tasks can all be done with user accounts and service accounts connected to 
CyberArk.
